      Hello!! I'm a Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of
      California, Santa Barbara. I'm especially interested in the ways in which
      queer and trans folks use language in unique ways to construct identity
      and community, and in using computational models and methods to approach
      sociolinguistic problems. I recently finished my B.A. at the University of
      California, Berkeley in linguistics and computer science. While at Cal,
      I wrote a thesis on how to use computational models as an alternative
      method for identifying acoustic signals of queer speech, and worked as an
      editor on the <a href="https://www.genderinlanguage.com/" target="_blank">Gender in Language Project</a>.
