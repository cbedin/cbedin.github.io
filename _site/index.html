<h1 id="hello">hello!</h1>

<p>i’m a linguist studying queer and trans language. i’m a graduate student at uc santa barbara, where i’m a member of the <a href="https://trillucsb.org/">trans research in linguistics lab (trill)</a> under dr. lal zimman, and the <a href="https://ucsb-cpls-lab.github.io/">computational psycholinguistics of listening and speaking (cpls) lab</a> under dr. simon todd.</p>

<p>these are some things i do research on!</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#you-guys-and-yall">english second-person pronouns <em>you guys</em> and <em>y’all</em></a></li>
  <li><a href="#perceptual-sociophonetics">perceptions of gender, sexuality, and the voice</a></li>
  <li><a href="#sex-and-gender-in-linguistics">trans-affirming statistical/quantitative methods</a></li>

<p>thanks for visiting my little page 👾💕</p>

<h1 id="research">research</h1>

<p>below are little blurbs and citations about my current/ongoing research projects! i’ve linked materials that are already publicly available online, but i am also (usually) happy to share slides if you send me an email.</p>

<h2 id="you-guys-and-yall"><em>you guys</em> and <em>y’all</em></h2>

<p>my (in progress) m.a. thesis work looks at attitudes towards the english second-person plural constructions <em>you guys</em> and <em>y’all</em>, and how these attitudes are impacted by ideologies about race, place, and gender. i’m especially interested in how metalinguistic discourse and sociopolitical ideologies shape language, and i think <em>you guys</em> and <em>y’all</em> are a great lens into these phenomena because they implicate many politicized issues around language, identity, and power (e.g. gender-inclusive language, lingusitic appropriation, and linguistic stigma).</p>

<p>this work has been presented at lavender languages (lavlang), the language interaction and social organization (liso) conference at ucsb, and the american anthropological association (aaa) annual meeting. i’ve also written a more informal piece about this work for the linguistic society of america (lsa)’s committee on lgbtq+[z] issues (cozil) <a href="https://www.lsadc.org/af_membercommittee.asp?committeeid=14&amp;sp=40">2024 pride month blog series</a>.</p>

<h2 id="perceptual-sociophonetics">perceptual sociophonetics</h2>

<p>for my b.a. honors thesis, i ran an experiment looking at what acoustic properties of a person’s voice can contribute to making a person “sound gay.” while there has been extensive research in this area already, results across different studies are often inconsistent and difficult to replicate, suggesting that this phenomenon is highly variable and complex. to that end, more recently i’ve been interested in applying cognitive and computational models to this phenomenon, with the hopes that cognitively-informed models will offer more explanatory power. i’m especially interested in the role that variation in listener perception might play in this phenomenon.</p>

<p>i presented a poster and wrote a <a href="https://guarant.cz/icphs2023/399.pdf">proceedings paper</a> for the international congress of phonetic sciences (icphs), applying exemplar theory and modeling to this phenomenon. additionally, i have presented another analysis at the variation and language processing (valp) conference where i used heirarchical clustering to look at listener variation.</p>

<h2 id="sex-and-gender-in-linguistics">sex and gender in linguistics</h2>

<p>this project is a larger collaboration that has included montreal benesch, kirby conrod, marina zhukova, and lal zimman, where we’re aiming to take a critical look at how linguists deal with sex/gender in their work. ultimately, we hope to be able to provide empirically and ethically-informed guidelines to help linguists approach sex and gender in ways that are affirming and accurate. one of my personal interests in this project is trans-affirming statistical and quantitative methods, as quantitative linguistics generally lags behind qualitative linguistics in its treatment of sex and gender.</p>

<p>so far, we have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>presented talks talk at the new ways of analyzing variation (nwav) conference in which we discuss two trans-affirming methods for operationalizing gender.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>run a workshop at the linguistic society of america (lsa)’s annual meeting regarding best practices for asking sex/gender information from research participants, <a href="https://bit.ly/LSA2024GenderQuestionMaterials">for which we produced materials that are publicly available</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>conducted a survey of linguists (n=157 to date) asking about current norms and practices in the field for collecting sex/gender information. this survey was also presented at the lsa’s annual meeting, and we <a href="https://doi.org/10.3765/plsa.v9i1.5668">wrote a proceedings paper about the results</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>and we have more in the works, so stay tuned!</p>

<h1 id="teaching">teaching</h1>

<h2 id="at-uc-santa-barbara">at uc santa barbara</h2>

<p>at ucsb i have taught foundations of computational linguistcs as a substitute teaching assistant; and have taught language, gender, and sexuality as a teaching assistant. this upcoming academic year i will be teaching an introductory linguistics course as a teaching assistant, and advanced computational linguistics as a teaching assistant.</p>

<h2 id="at-uc-berkeley">at uc berkeley</h2>

<h3 id="cs-61a">cs 61a</h3>

<p>as an undergraduate student i taught extensively in uc berkeley’s computer science department, mainly focused on the course <a href="https://cs61a.org/">computer science 61a: the structure and interpretation of computer programs</a>. cs 61a is the first prerequisite course for students interested in the major, so it’s nominally an introductory course, although the the speed and the intensity of the material makes the course an inordinate challenge for students who do not already have experience programming. i got involved with teaching the class because i saw what a challenge the course was - especially for students of marginalized backgrounds, disabled students, and students with extenuating life circustances - and my hope was to contribute (at least in a small way) to making the course more accessible. notably, cs 61a is one of the (if not the) largest in-person courses in the united states, enrolling approximately 2000 students in fall semesters, 1500 in spring semesters, and 300–700 in summer sessions. this means that working for the course not only involved teaching, but also working with the custom software infrastucture used to manage a course of this scale.</p>

<p>i taught cs 61a 9 semesters (including summers): 1 as an academic intern (unpaid), 2 as a course tutor, 3 as a teaching assistant, 2 as a head teaching assistant, and 1 as an instructor. my proudest contribution to the course was developing  accessibility infrastructure for the course - especially regarding assignment extensions, for which there was no infrastructure before. i also taught special sections for students enrolled in berkeley’s cs scholars program, which is a program aimed at helping first-generation college students pursue computer science degrees. i lastly contributed in smaller ways to the course’s content generation and grading software.</p>

<p>i received extremely positive feedback that my contributions to the course made it more accessible for students who otherwise would have had difficulty managing the workload, and i received an outstanting graduate student instructor award in my last year for my teaching. i still feel that the course had a long way to go at the time i graduated.</p>

<h2 id="computer-science-mentors">computer science mentors</h2>

<p>at berkeley, in addition to my official involvement as a teaching assistant, i was also involved in <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/">computer science mentors (csm)</a>, a student-run teaching organization offering small-group tutoring to students enrolled in lower-divison computer science classes. csm is one of the (if not the) largest such organizations in the united states, involving approximately 300 mentors and 1500 students each semester. csm is able to work at such scale because of its organizational structure, where senior mentors lead “families” of junior mentors to help them develop teaching skills. csm would consistently receive feedback from the department that we made up a crucial part of its teaching infrastucture, particularly in supporting students who do not have prior programming experience, and in training mentors who would then become undergraduate teaching assistants.</p>

<p>i was involved with csm for 6 semesters, over which i taught 5 small-group sections for 2 classes: <a href="#cs-61a">computer science 61a</a> and electrical engineering 16a (berkeley’s introductory electrical engineering course). in fall 2021 i taught csm’s first lgbtq+ affinity section, intended for students for whom there were otherwise not really any designated spaces in the department. this was an expansion of csm’s existing affinity sections for women, and csm now offers many such affinity sections to students of all kinds of identities.</p>

<p>i was also involved in csm’s executive board as socials chair, external vice president, and president over various semesters.</p>
