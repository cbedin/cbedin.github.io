# hello!

i'm a linguist studying queer and trans language. i'm a graduate student at uc santa barbara, where i'm a member of the [trans research in linguistics lab (trill)](https://trillucsb.org/) under dr. lal zimman, and the [computational psycholinguistics of listening and speaking (cpls) lab](https://ucsb-cpls-lab.github.io/) under dr. simon todd.

these are some things i do research on!

* [perceptions of gender, sexuality, and the voice](#sociophonetics)
